Peter finds a good balance between what is essential and what can be left to readers, so this book is an efficient yet comprehensible source for starting programming with Kotlin.” –Bernhard Rumpe, Professor of Software Engineering, RWTH Aachen University The Kotlin language brings state-of-the-art programming techniques and constructs to Android development. Kotlin for Android App Development will help you rapidly understand Kotlin’s principles and techniques, apply Kotlin in production app development, integrate Kotlin with existing Java code, and plan a migration to Kotlin, if you choose. If you have at least basic programming experience (with any language), Peter Sommerhoff’s well-crafted overview and examples will help you get quickly up-to-speed with the Kotlin language, its constructs, and its advanced functional and object-oriented capabilities. Once you’ve mastered these foundations, Sommerhoff walks you through two complete app development projects, introducing best practices and emerging patterns for writing code that’s robust, concise, readable, and highly performant. Understand Kotlin’s goals, principles, advantages, design, and constructs Take full advantage of functional programming in the Kotlin environment Write more concise and reusable code using Kotlin’s object-oriented features Interoperate with existing Java code, and plan a migration to Kotlin Use coroutines to efficiently handle concurrency Capture data via third-party APIs, map it to internal data representations, and present it to users Master best practices for architecting Kotlin Android apps Improve productivity and readability by creating simple domain-specific languages in Kotlin",

        "description": "Unleash the Power of Kotlin for Android App Development DESCRIPTION This book aims to provide the knowledge around the fundamental concept of Kotlin languages, and it’s an application in Android application development. It covers basic to advanced concepts with practical examples. Each chapter in this book is a step by step journey towards the learning Kotlin and excel in various topics and concepts. It covers topics like data types, various functions, including lambdas and higher-order functions. It also covers advanced topics like Generics, Collections, DSL, Coroutine, etc. Most importantly, such concepts are explained with practical usage of it in Android application. You will get to know what is the best possible way to use these concepts while you develop an Android application. In this book, along with Kotlin, an attempt has been made where few Android-specific topics are also explained. For example, the application is using Architecture components, including ViewModel, LiveData, NavigationComponent, and also it uses Flow, which is a hot topic in Kotlin. While we learn this concept, along with that, we also develop a sample application where we can apply our learning and, in the end, have some tangible and measurable output. Readers with little previous knowledge of Android application development can easily follow this book. Most of the chapters are code-heavy and focuses on practical usage of Kotlin’s features. Each chapter has code on the GitHub. You can check out this code and try it out. Or you can develop in parallel and cherry-pick things from the sample code base as and when you need it. Few chapters also follow the quiz at the end, and you can self assess yourself by going through that quiz. In total there are ten chapters. KEY FEATURES The book has theories explained elaborately along with Kotlin code and corresponding output to support the theoretical explanations. The Kotlin codes are provided with step-by-step comments to explain each instruction of the code. The book is quite well balanced with programs and illustrative real-case problems. The book is not just explaining theoretical concepts of the language. Still, it explains how the full-fledged application can be developed using some latest tools and technologies and create an excellent Android application using Kotlin. Few of the chapter offers the quiz at the end of it. And you can revise the concepts quickly. A rich sample application is created to demonstrate Kotlin’s capability in various parts of the application. Quite the latest concepts are discussed in depth. For example, Flow, NavigationComponent, Coroutine, ViewModel, and LiveData. WHAT WILL YOU LEARN Know the basics and many advanced concepts of Android. Able to code in Kotlin for your Android application. You will know how architecture components can be used in Android application with Kotlin. Writing tests that use coroutine, Flow, LiveData, and ViewModel. What measures you need to take before you put an application in production. How agile practices can be applied before and after the application development is started. WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR The book is for readers with basic programming and android application development skills. The book is for any engineering graduates that wish to use Kotlin as a programming language for their Android application or wish to build a career in this direction. This book can also be useful for those who want to learn how testing aspects work for Android applications. The use cases and programs discussed in the book are self-explanatory and detailed with practical examples wherever necessary. This is why the book can be read by anyone who has an interest in Kotlin and Android and how applications are developed with the industry level standard maintained. TABLE OF CONTENTS 1.
